Python packages:
* utm package
* matlab
* utm2ll

Can convert from Mercator to Longitude and latitude to make it easier to work with

Velocities are depth averaged and will need to use formula to convert to velocity


Ideas:

* Could do the channel over a whole tidal period
* Investigate the velocity profile through the water (cross seciton of the water column) - looking at bottom roughness coefficient to see how that effects things
* Where would be a good place to put the tidal powerstation

Animation:
* gganimate in R
* Shiny apps
